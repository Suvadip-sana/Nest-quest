## **Getting Started**

### **Fork the Repository**
1. Navigate to the [NestQuest GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Suvadip-sana/Nest-quest).

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Suvadip-sana/Nest-quest.git
```

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- MongoDB Atlas Account

Install dependencies:

Set up the environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

## **Development Workflow**

### **1. Create a Branch**
Always create a new branch for your work to keep changes isolated.
```bash
$ git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### **2. Write and Test Code**
Make sure your changes donâ€™t break the project. Test thoroughly before committing.

### **3. Commit Changes**
Write clear, concise, and meaningful commit messages.
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add feature/bug fix description"
```

### **4. Keep Your Branch Updated**
Fetch changes from the `main` branch periodically to avoid merge conflicts.
```bash
$ git fetch origin
$ git merge origin/main
```

---

## **Code Standards**

- Use clear and descriptive variable names.
- Follow JavaScript/Node.js best practices.
- Write comments for complex logic.
- Format your code using a linter (e.g., ESLint). Run the linter before committing:
```bash
$ npm run lint
```

---

## **Creating a Pull Request**

1. Push your branch to GitHub:
```bash
$ git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Navigate to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request:
   - Provide a clear title and description of your changes.
   - Mention the issue number it addresses (if applicable) using `Closes #issue-number`.

3. Wait for reviews and address feedback promptly.

1. Go to the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/Suvadip-sana/Nest-quest/issues).
